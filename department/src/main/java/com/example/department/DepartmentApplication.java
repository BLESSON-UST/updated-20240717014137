The code provided is for a Spring Boot application with Eureka Client enabled. There is no specific version mentioned in the code, so I will assume that the code is written in a version compatible with Spring Boot 2.x.

Here is the modified code that includes the latest standards and best practices, and is compatible with Spring Boot 2.x:

```java
package com.example.department;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class DepartmentApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DepartmentApplication.class, args);
	}

}
```

Please note that the `@EnableEurekaClient` annotation has been replaced with `@EnableDiscoveryClient`. This change allows for enabling service discovery with other service registry clients, not just Eureka.

If you need the modified pom.xml and application.properties files as well, please let me know.
